# Deutsche Gebärdensprache

The objective of this project is to build a small scale recognition
system for Deutsche Gebärdensprache (DGS). The system recognizes signs,
converts them to text, and then generates artificial speech. I have
limited the scope of this project to a few signs because a more fully
functional app for translation is a fulltime job in itself and poses
many challenges and difficulties.
